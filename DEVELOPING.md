# Developing Event Calendar (Developer Notes)

This document explains how the project is structured and how to edit, test, and deploy it.

## Project overview
- Backend: FastMCP + FastAPI (see `main.py`). MCP tools (functions) are added using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator and are exposed via the `/api/mcp` endpoint.
- Serverless wrapper: `api/mcp.py` contains a Vercel-compatible handler used for serverless deployments (supports preflight CORS and unwraps common response shapes).
- Frontend: Static files in `public/`:
  - `index.html` — top-level markup and layout
  - `style.css` — all styles (theme variables live here)
  - `script.js` — chat UI behavior, localStorage, and API calls

> Note: Events are currently stored in-memory on the server (`events` list in `main.py`) and will reset on cold starts or redeploys. For persistent data, add a database and persist events.

## Local development

Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 (see `.python-version`)
- `pip` and optionally `venv` or other virtual environment tooling
- (Optional) Vercel CLI for local serverless testing and deployment

Quick start
1. Create and activate a virtualenv (macOS example):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the test harness (calls the serverless handler directly):

```bash
python test_local.py
```

3. Run the app locally (FastAPI + uvicorn):

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

4. To experiment with the serverless wrapper locally (`api/mcp.py`) you can use `vercel dev` (requires Vercel CLI) or call `handler()` directly in an async test harness (see `test_local.py`).

## Editing the frontend

Files of interest:
- `public/index.html` — edit structure, add UI elements, ARIA roles
- `public/style.css` — theme variables at the top using `:root` and `[data-theme="light"]` overrides; change `--bg`, `--panel-bg`, `--text`, and `--muted` for global color changes.
- `public/script.js` — key functions:
  - `renderMessage(msg)` — how messages are rendered in the DOM (avatar, bubble, meta)
  - `addLocalMessage(text, who)` — adds messages to local `chat[]` and persists to `localStorage` (`chat_messages` key)
  - `showTyping()` / `removeTyping()` — typing indicator
  - `setFetching(state)` — disables composer and shows spinner while waiting for a reply
  - Theme helpers: `setTheme(t)` and `loadTheme()` manage `data-theme` attribute

Tips:
- Avatars: change the emoji strings in `renderMessage` and `showTyping`.
- Adding UI elements: update the HTML markup and corresponding CSS classes; keep `messages` container as `role="log" aria-live="polite"` for screen readers.
- Persisted state: `localStorage` is used for chat persistence — clear it to reset saved conversations.

## Editing the backend

- `main.py` contains the FastMCP instance and FastAPI app.
- `handle_message` is implemented as a conversational parser to allow more natural phrases (see the function docstring in `main.py` for details).
- To add or tweak conversational patterns:
  - Edit `handle_message` in `main.py`. The function uses a small set of regexes to interpret common forms (add/create/schedule with `on YYYY-MM-DD`, `today`, `tomorrow`; delete/remove/cancel; list queries with optional dates; summarize variants).
  - Keep parsing simple and test with `curl` or `test_local.py` after changes. Aim for clarity and predictable fallbacks — when in doubt return a short help message rather than guessing user intent.

- To add a new tool:
  - Decorate the function with `@mcp.tool()` (or `@mcp.prompt()` for prompt-style wrappers)
  - Keep functions simple and return serializable strings or objects
  - Example:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def my_tool(foo: str) -> str:
    return f"You passed {foo}"
```

- The FastAPI endpoint `/api/mcp` expects JSON: `{"tool":"tool_name","input":{...}}`.
- Test tools via `curl` or http clients. Example:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool":"handle_message","input":{"message":"list"}}'
```

- `api/mcp.py` is a convenience wrapper for serverless deployments; it supports both frameworks that pass `request.json()` as a coroutine and frameworks that pass a dict-like `request` object.

## Deployment (Vercel)

- The project contains `vercel.json` with an `installCommand` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and a redirect from `/` to `/index.html`.
- To deploy:
  - Install and login with `vercel` CLI
  - `vercel deploy` and follow prompts
  - Note: function runtime pinning caused validation issues before; prefer letting Vercel auto-detect the runtime or use an accepted `functions` configuration.

---

## Testing & QA

- Basic tests: `test_local.py` (sanity test calls the handler directly)
- Manual API checks: use `curl` or `httpie` against `/api/mcp`
- Front-end checks: run `uvicorn` and open the page; watch console logs in the browser devtools
- Accessibility: check `aria-live` announcements, contrast (Lighthouse / axe), keyboard focus states

---

## Style, linting, and formatting (recommended)
- Add `black`, `ruff`, and `pre-commit` for consistent formatting and linting
- Example install:

```bash
python -m pip install black ruff pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

---

## Git workflow
- Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/chat-ui`, `fix/light-theme-contrast`)
- Commit messages: short prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `docs:`) followed by a concise description
- Open PRs for changes and request at least one reviewer

---

## Where to look when things break
- Server logs (uvicorn output) for tracebacks
- Browser console/network tab for failed fetches to `/api/mcp`
- `vercel logs <deployment>` for serverless runtime issues

---

## Contact / Maintainers
- Repo owner: (replace with actual maintainer contact info)

If you'd like, I can also add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a simple `Makefile` with common dev tasks (install, run, test, lint). Let me know which extras you want.
